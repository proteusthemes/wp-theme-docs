<p>
	Most of our themes come with our own demo products for the WooCommerce store and will be imported automatically when you <a href="#one-click-demo-install">import the demo content</a> using our <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/">industry-leading One Click Demo Import plugin</a>. You need to make sure that <strong>WooCommerce is activated at the time that you import the demo data</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	However, you can (optionally) install the additional demo products by WooCommerce. Go to <strong>Tools » Import » WordPress</strong> and import the demo XML file which can be found in the folder where WooCommerce was installed on your server. Usually this is in <code>wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/dummy-data/dummy-data.xml</code>. Also check the <strong>Download and import file attachments</strong> checkbox, so that all product images will be downloaded as well.
</p>
<p>
	When you're done, you should see the products:
</p>

<div class="info">
	If you want to feature certain products, you can do so by clicking a <strong>star</strong> symbol in the table seen above.

<p>
	When you are done with the settings, go to <strong>Appearance » Widgets</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	Drag &amp; Drop the <a href="https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-widgets/" target="_blank">WooCommerce widgets</a> to the sidebar called <strong>Shop Sidebar</strong>.
